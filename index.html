          <p>
            My name is Andrew Miller. I have been a personal trainer for over 10 years. 
            The image I chose was of a baseball stadium since I played baseball in college and the minor leagues. 
            My hobbies include going to the movies, sporting events, being outside, traveling, and spending time with my family.

    <div>
        Data science is a field I have been interested in for a while. I have been into technology along with the health and fitness industries. 
        This career has many different opportunities, great starting pay, and being able to help the company that I work for or start my own business. 
        In this field, I will be involved in many of the day-to-day decisions involved with the business.
